# notes

This is the new (canonical?) version of my notes

## New with this release:
- Notes are public by default
- Soka-compliant (GPLv3 + The Golden Rule)
- Target editor is GNU Emacs (formerly it was Obsidian)

This is a public repository of free software! Second most important rule is to have fun.
